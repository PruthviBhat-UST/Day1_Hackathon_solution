overview : 
            Every website must have the SSL certificate, and it will be valid till some time, in order to inform the 
            owner about the SSL, we will create the shell scripting in which we will log the SSL certificate expiry date
            (last 5 days remaining) and mail them using MTA postfix.

implementation steps :
1) create a file
2) grant execute permission to files using chmod +x
3) use the openssl utlity library and get the info from the domain
4) implement the extraction of date from that info into proper strctured date format
5) check the condition whether the given date is nearer( 5 days) from the expiry by comapring it with today's date
6) if so then send an email to the owner saying that certificate is about to expire. using postfix MTA

outcome:
        the owner will be able to get to know their ssl certificate expiry and take proper actions without continous human 
        observation rather than manually checking the expiry date daily.
